We host events for everything computing related this ranges from; how to setup your own website and storing your photos online to System Administration and Computer Programming Tutorials. We also host a number of services for our membership. A Brief History \u00b6 In October of 1995 a group of friends started the ball rolling on the idea of a computer network in DCU, run by students for the students. Starting out with a battered 386 PC (dubbed Nurse), bits of borrowed memory, their own cash, and a lot of luck, they went about organising the DCU Networking Society. Once recognised as a society, they were allowed to setup a temporary home for our server in the Computer Applications faculty. With the approval of John Boland, the then head of Computer Services in DCU, the society received its own subnet, dubbed Redbrick, along with a physical area in which to store Nurse, our one and only machine. Since April 9th 1996, when the machine went officially online, the society itself has grown rapidly. So rapidly in fact, that we are one of the largest societies on/off campus! Redbrick\u2019s social side has grown a lot also, with the society celebrating its 20th Anniversary back in April 2016. The society continues to run their annual Freshers Ball, Halloween Party, Christmas Party and Tech Week throughout the year. As one of the biggest societies in DCU, we\u2019re always looking for new membership. The membership fee itself is a paltry \u20ac4.00 until Clubs & Socs Day 2 (generally mid February) when the membership cost drops to \u20ac2.00! However outside of Clubs & Socs days it becomes a little awkward to sign up, but it is more than doable - check here for details on how to pay. Our current main server is Azazel, with Pygmalion also providing login services to users. See the Redbrick Hardware Inventory for descriptions of our servers and other equipment.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about","text":"","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about-redbrick","text":"Redbrick is DCU \u2019s Computer Networking society.

If you have any ideas, feel free to mail us with your suggestions. Since 1996, we have been providing people with an excellent, powerful and flexible UNIX environment. We have used Solaris, Linux and FreeBSD, some more than others. First off, we give you 2GB of disk space by default - having somewhere online to store files and mail is essential these days, especially if you log on from a wide range of locations. We also provide you with your own Email account, and a great range of clients to read/write it with! Many people love to code, you can log on to Pygmalion, our development server, which has every compiler under the sun installed, and if you find we don\u2019t have the one that you need, let us know and we will try help you out. You should always back up your code. We have git installed on Redbrick so have a look here at how to get started, and check out Redbrick Git for free git hosting! Mail \u00b6 Once you have your username and password you can use the webmail service we offer on Redbrick. Mail from your Redbrick address auto goes to your DCU email. This can stop by typing forward off in terminal on Redbrick, but we don\u2019t know why you\u2019d want to do a thing like that. Hosting \u00b6 We currently offer 2 different types of web hosting: https://[username].redbrick.dcu.ie - per user subdomains is on by default for all users https://something.com/ - Custom domain hosting is also available, where the hostname is that of a domain you own, all you have to do is Email the Weebmaster and get your DNS provider to point the domain at our IP address. We also ask that users who have virtual hosts link their site to our homepage. Coding \u00b6 Redbrick is a great place to learn or use a vast range of programming languages, we have compilers, interpreters and libraries for: Java, C++/C, Assembly, Perl, Python, PHP, Ruby, Shell, Haskell, Objective C, NodeJs, Go Additionally we provide databases for projects and personal use.
